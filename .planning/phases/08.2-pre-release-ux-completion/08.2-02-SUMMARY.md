# Dependency graph
requires:
  - phase: 01-foundation-infrastructure
    provides: tutorial overlay UI, translation system, settings pattern
provides:
  - 4-screen end-user tutorial covering Bird Randomizer, Word Tracker, Topics, and Setup
  - CustomEvent-based reopen mechanism (no prop drilling)
  - Tutorial reopen button in Settings About section

# Tech tracking
tech-stack:
  added: []
  patterns:
    - "CustomEvent dispatch pattern: SettingsPage dispatches 'open-tutorial', App.tsx listens — no prop drilling needed across unrelated component trees"

key-files:
  created: []
  modified:
    - src/components/Tutorial.tsx
    - src/locales/de/translation.json
    - src/App.tsx
    - src/components/pages/SettingsPage.tsx

key-decisions:
  - "Custom DOM event (open-tutorial) chosen over prop drilling or context for reopen: simpler, keeps SettingsPage unaware of App state"
  - "Tutorial screen count raised from 3 to 4: Welcome, Bird Randomizer, Word Tracker+Topics, Setup"
  - "Old internal dev-phase screen (phases 1-5 roadmap) removed entirely — irrelevant to end users"
  - "launchAtLogin toggle kept on final setup screen — still useful for users even on reopen"

patterns-established:
  - "CustomEvent pattern: window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('event-name')) + useEffect listener in App.tsx — reuse for other global UI triggers"

# Phase 8.2 Plan 02: Tutorial Rewrite Summary

**4-screen end-user tutorial replacing internal dev-phase roadmap, with CustomEvent-based reopen from Settings About section**

## Performance

- **Duration:** ~4 min
- **Started:** 2026-02-24T00:00:00Z
- **Completed:** 2026-02-24T00:04:00Z
- **Tasks:** 2 (Task 1: Tutorial.tsx + translations; Task 2: App.tsx event + SettingsPage button)
- **Files modified:** 4

## Accomplishments

- Replaced 3-screen internal dev-phase tutorial with 4 end-user screens: Welcome, Bird Randomizer, Word Tracker & Topics, Setup
- Added `open-tutorial` CustomEvent listener in App.tsx so any component can reopen the tutorial without prop drilling
- Added "Tutorial erneut anzeigen" button in SettingsPage About section using btn-outline pattern
- Updated all translation keys — removed 10 old phase keys, added 9 user-focused keys

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Tasks 1+2: Tutorial rewrite + event system + Settings button** - `be776a0` (feat)

**Plan metadata:** (docs commit follows)

## Files Created/Modified

- `src/components/Tutorial.tsx` - Completely rewritten: 4 screens (Welcome/Bird/Tracker/Setup), TOTAL_SCREENS=4, void handleFinish() on last screen
- `src/locales/de/translation.json` - Tutorial block replaced: old phase1-phase5 keys removed, new bird_title/tracker_title/setup_title/reopen_btn keys added
- `src/App.tsx` - Added useEffect listening for 'open-tutorial' CustomEvent to call setShowTutorial(true)
- `src/components/pages/SettingsPage.tsx` - Added settings-row with btn-outline button dispatching 'open-tutorial' in About section

## Decisions Made

- CustomEvent pattern chosen for reopen (no prop drilling, no context API needed): SettingsPage is deep in the tree and unaware of App-level tutorial state
- Old "features_title", "current_phase", and all phase1-phase5 translation keys removed — they were dev-internal and meaningless to users
- Screen 4 (Setup) retained the launchAtLogin toggle because it remains useful even on reopen flows

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - SettingsPage.tsx had shifted line numbers from the plan description, but the content was identical and Edit matched correctly.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Next Phase Readiness

- Tutorial is ready for QA: first-launch flow and Settings reopen both work
- No TypeScript errors (tsc --noEmit passes clean)
- Continuation of Phase 8.2 UX completion work can proceed
