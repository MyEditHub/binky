# Plan 08.2-03 Summary: Topics Page Redesign

**Status:** Complete
**Completed:** 2026-02-24

## What Was Built

Topics page made visible to all end users, episode management section removed, analysis auto-triggers silently on page load, topic cards simplified to a single contextual action.

## Tasks Completed

| Task | Commit | Files |
|------|--------|-------|
| Task 1: Topics visible in sidebar | `ef8ddde` | `src/components/Sidebar.tsx` |
| Task 2: Simplified TopicsPage with auto-analysis | `ef8ddde` | `src/components/pages/TopicsPage.tsx` |
| Task 3: Simplified TopicRow (done/reopen) | `ef8ddde` | `src/components/Topics/TopicRow.tsx` |

## Deliverables

- `Sidebar.tsx`: topics nav item changed from `devOnly: true` to `devOnly: false` — visible to all users
- `TopicsPage.tsx`: episode management section removed; `autoAnalyzedRef` pattern added to silently analyze all `not_started` episodes on mount (if OpenAI key configured); filter tabs reduced to Offen / Erledigt
- `TopicRow.tsx`: 3-button status bar replaced with single contextual button — "Erledigt" when offen, "Offen" when erledigt

## Deviations

None.
