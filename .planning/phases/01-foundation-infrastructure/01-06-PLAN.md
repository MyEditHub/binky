<objective>
Verify the complete Phase 1 foundation by launching the app, walking through the tutorial, checking all UI states, and confirming the build pipeline is ready.

Purpose: Human eyes catch visual issues, layout problems, and UX awkwardness that automated checks miss. This is the final gate before Phase 1 is complete.

Output: Verified working app or list of issues to fix.

  <name>Task 1: Run full build and automated verification</name>
  <files></files>
  <action>
    Run these automated checks before human verification:

    1. `npm install` - Verify clean install
    2. `npx tsc --noEmit` - TypeScript compilation passes
    3. `cd src-tauri && cargo check` - Rust compilation passes
    4. `npm run tauri dev` - App launches (keep running for human verification)
    5. Verify database file is created in Tauri's AppData directory
    6. Check that all translation keys in components exist in translation.json (grep for t() calls and verify against JSON)
    7. Verify `.github/workflows/release.yml` is valid YAML
    8. Verify `scripts/bump-version.sh` has execute permission

    Report results of each check.
  </action>
  <verify>
    All 8 checks pass without errors.

    All automated checks pass. App compiles, launches, and creates database.

  <what-built>
    Complete Phase 1 foundation:
    - Tauri v2 desktop app with German sidebar navigation
    - SQLite database with migration infrastructure
    - Auto-updater configuration with signing key
    - Sentry crash reporting integration
    - First-launch tutorial (3 screens)
    - Settings page with app info
    - GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow
    - macOS permissions and entitlements
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    The app should be running from Task 1 (`npm run tauri dev`).

    1. **First Launch Tutorial:**
       - Tutorial modal should appear automatically
       - Screen 1: Welcome message in German
       - Screen 2: Phase roadmap overview
       - Screen 3: Launch-at-login toggle
       - Click through all screens and complete tutorial
       - Restart app (`npm run tauri dev` again) - tutorial should NOT appear again

    2. **Sidebar Navigation:**
       - Left sidebar shows: Episoden, Analytik, Themen, Vogel-Randomizer, Einstellungen
       - "Episoden" and "Einstellungen" are clickable (active)
       - "Analytik", "Themen", "Vogel-Randomizer" are grayed out (disabled)
       - Click "Episoden" - shows episodes page with empty state message
       - Click "Einstellungen" - shows settings page

    3. **Settings Page:**
       - Shows app version (0.1.0)
       - Shows database status (connected/Verbunden)
       - Launch-at-login toggle is interactive

    4. **Theme Support:**
       - Switch macOS system theme between light and dark mode
       - App should follow system theme automatically
       - Both themes should look clean and readable

    5. **German Language:**
       - Check that ALL visible text is in German
       - No English strings should be visible anywhere
       - Check page titles, navigation labels, empty states, buttons

    6. **Design Check:**
       - Minimal design, no gradients
       - Brand colors present
       - macOS system font (text should look native)
       - Window resizes correctly down to minimum size (800x600)
       - Sidebar stays functional at minimum width

    Report: "approved" if everything looks good, or describe specific issues.
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" or describe issues to fix</resume-signal>
